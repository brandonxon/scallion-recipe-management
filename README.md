# Recipe Management With the Scallion API

## Summary
* This is a server only API designed to teach the beginnings of node, express, RESTful APIs, and HTTP Transactions
* There is no front end here: just a server and a .JSON file for data storage

## Setup 
1. Download ZIP file or `git clone` the repo to desired directory 
2. If you downloaded the ZIP file, extract its contents
3. Navigate to the scallion direcotry 
4. `npm install`
5. Open directory in code editor of your choosing 

### Agenda
1. Get setup 
2. Write your "helloScallion" application
3. Write your `GET /recipes` route, and use your first middleware
4. Write your first `POST /recipes` route, and now experience the power of using a middleware *chain*
5. Complete the CRUD quad-fecta!
6. Tinker away!
